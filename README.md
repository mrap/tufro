### Tweet at [@JamSkippy](https://twitter.com/JamSkippy) or DM message like this: 

    "Stanford > Philz"

### You can omit the starting location if your tweet has a geolocation: 

    "> Philz"

### Try different things! You can use any place-like ref (think: google maps search bar):

    "San Mateo Supercharger to Oakland"
    "1 Infinite Loop -> Starbucks"
    "Oracle Arena->SF"
